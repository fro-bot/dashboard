Contract: OPERATOR_CONTRACT_VERSION = 1.0.0
Vendored copy — do not hand-edit behavior. Refresh by re-copying upstream and
re-applying the documented import rewrites (@fro-bot/runtime → ../../result.ts;
inlined boundary types for RunPhase/Surface/RunState).

## Omissions vs upstream

The following upstream exports are omitted because they depend on upstream-only types:

- `toOperatorDecisionState` — requires `DecisionOutcome` from `../approvals/registry.js`
- `toOperatorRunStatus` — requires `RunState` from `@fro-bot/runtime`
- `DecisionInput` — requires `ApprovalActor` from `../approvals/registry.js`

The PUBLIC frozen types (OperatorDecisionState, OperatorWebStatus, OperatorRunStatus,
OperatorSessionInfo, OperatorCsrfToken, OperatorOk, OperatorError, OperatorIdentity,
RunPhase, Surface, PermissionReply, RedactionContext) are all present and correct.

## Import rewrites applied

- `parse.ts`: `import type {Result} from '@fro-bot/runtime'` → `import type {Result} from '../../result.ts'`
- `parse.ts`: `import {err, ok} from '@fro-bot/runtime'` → `import {err, ok} from '../../result.ts'`
- `run-status.ts`: `import type {RunPhase, RunState, Surface} from '@fro-bot/runtime'` → inlined as local type definitions
- `approval.ts`: `import type {ApprovalActor, DecisionOutcome} from '../approvals/registry.js'` → removed (dependent helpers omitted)
